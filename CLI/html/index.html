      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Congratulations on starting the server through the CLI. Well done. You
        will now be able to access most of the commands through this web
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find a variety of links that will take you to various
        pages that I have created. I recommend keeping your developer console
        open during your stay, so that you can keep an eye on how things
        function behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the features here don't work <i>entirely</i> as I hoped they
        would. Without a useState, I wasn't able to clear the forms when
        submitting their data, for example. But it works well enough for what I
        needed it to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd recommend starting by going to the
        <strong>
          <a href="http://localhost:3000/token">Create an Account</a></strong
        >
        page and creating a new user token for yourself. Once that's finished,
        copy your token ID to your clipboard and go to the
        <strong>
          <a href="http://localhost:3000/login">Account Confirmation</a></strong
        >
        page and confirm your account. You should notice your token update
        itself once you do this.
      </p>
